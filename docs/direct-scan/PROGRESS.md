# PROGRESS: state and changelog

Claude Code: read this file FIRST in every session, and update it after every task (see `CLAUDE.md` section 3).
Newest changelog entries go at the top of the Changelog.

## Current state

## Repo facts (filled in by Phase 0)

- Go version: (TBD)
- Package map: (TBD)

- Trivy version pinned: (TBD)
- Build / test / lint commands: (TBD)
- CI: (TBD)
- Baseline test result before our changes: (TBD)

## Decisions

Record decisions here with date and reason (package layout, Mongo test strategy, OCI client approach, DB swap mechanism, anything the user answered). If a decision changes the spec, also propose the edit to `DEMAND.md`.

- 2026-10-14: Digest store collection declined by the owner for now (hard to implement); the last scan of a digest is found through the `scans` collection. Multi-architecture handling and queue priorities are deferred. (See DEMAND section 14.)

## Upstream files touched

List every file from the original upstream repo that we modify, with the reason.

Touched before this plan started (commits `0c87038` "some modifyins" and `f917cc0` "smoke", on top of upstream `2691434`):

- `Dockerfile`: multi-stage build that compiles the binary in the image; `GOPROXY` set to `package-mirror.liara.ir`, `GOSUMDB=off`; `GOTRACEBACK=all`.
- `Dockerfile.dev`: same `GOPROXY` and `GOSUMDB` settings.
- `pkg/trivy/model.go`: `ScanResult.Type`, `Report.Results`, and `Vulnerability.Target` / `Vulnerability.Type` (not serialized).
- `pkg/trivy/wrapper.go`: `parseJSONReport` copies Target and Type onto each vulnerability; logs the full Trivy report and every vulnerability at INFO (debug code).
- `pkg/scan/transformer.go`: Harbor `vendor_attributes` gets a `Trivy: {Target, Type}` entry for every vulnerability.
- `Vagrantfile`: trailing whitespace only.

- Next: <next task ID>
```

### 2026-10-15  CORRECTION  Docs location and earlier upstream changes
- Status: done
- What changed: the planning docs were at the repo root (untracked), not in `docs/direct-scan/` as this file and `CLAUDE.md` say. Moved them to `docs/direct-scan/`. Commits `0c87038` and `f917cc0` changed upstream files and were not mentioned anywhere; they are now listed under "Upstream files touched". Added the "boring, simple code" rule to `CLAUDE.md` section 2 (asked by the owner).
- Files: `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/direct-scan/*`
- Tests run: not applicable
- Decisions / surprises: see P0-2 for the test failures these earlier commits cause.
- Next: P0-1

### 2026-10-14  PLAN  Planning documents created
- Status: done
- What changed: created `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/direct-scan/DEMAND.md`, `PLAN.md`, `CHECKLIST.md`, `PROGRESS.md`. No code yet.
- Files: the five files above
- Tests run: not applicable
- Decisions / surprises: none
- Next: P0-1
